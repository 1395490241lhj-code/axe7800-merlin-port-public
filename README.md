**Public v3 — deterministic clean replay established; waiting for a matching 388_25xxx source package.**

A reproducibility lab for porting Asuswrt-Merlin to the **ASUS RT-AXE7800**
(Broadcom **BCM6756**, profile **96756GW**, 32-bit ARM).

Merlin baseline: **`asuswrt-merlin.ng`, branch `3006.102-wifi6`, commit
`ccd139a31d94de15d2da744083dbafbcfe97dcdf`**. That pinned lineage is *our* reproducibility
baseline; it is **not** claimed to be the source tree ASUS used for any retail firmware.

## Current state model

```
Published ASUS GPL 388.34458
    -> standalone buildable and internally coherent
    -> an older / different userspace generation than the shipping firmware

Pinned Merlin + RT-AXE7800 integration
    -> deterministic clean replay established (repro/clean-replay-v11)
    -> first clean blocker:
           invalid_nvram_get_program
           invalid_program_check
       at the write_smb_conf / libdisk link boundary
    -> downstream known gaps (NOT the current first blocker):
           libwebapi private contract
           s46comm-generation S46
    -> waiting for a matching current-generation ASUS source package
```

## Where the port actually stands

| | status |
|---|---|
| Standalone GPL 388.34458 build | **established** — builds from ASUS's own published package |
| Merlin-port clean replay | **established** — one script, zero manual steps, from the pinned commit |
| Current clean first blocker | `invalid_nvram_get_program`, `invalid_program_check` |
| Downstream known gaps | `libwebapi` private contract · `s46comm`-generation S46 |
| Merlin-side cross-product adaptations | resolved (see below) |
| Technical work | **intentionally frozen** pending authentic current-generation source/supply |

### The clean replay

[`repro/clean-replay-v11`](repro/clean-replay-v11/README.md) reconstructs the whole legitimate
integration state from the pinned commit in a single pass, with no manual mutable-worktree
state: model/config integration, authentic same-model GPL 388.34458 supply staged **only**
after per-file SHA-256 verification against a committed manifest, the accepted source
adaptations, and assertions that abort on any synthetic artifact reaching a supply directory.

Determinism was demonstrated across two independent fresh lineages: identical adapted-source
hashes, and the same first blocker both times.

**No synthetic, stub, or donor object is part of the clean port.** The replay refuses to
proceed if one is present.

### Current first blocker

    make[5]: *** [Makefile:77: write_smb_conf] Error 1     (libdisk)

    undefined reference to `invalid_nvram_get_program'
    undefined reference to `invalid_program_check'

Two symbols, at the `write_smb_conf` link. They have no open-source caller, are required by a
prebuilt `libnvram`, and the shipping firmware exercises the corresponding behaviour. Their
names indicate validation semantics, so **they are deliberately not stubbed, guessed, or
bypassed** — a permissive replacement could silently weaken input validation.

`libwebapi`/`priv_webapi` and `rc`/`s46comm` are demonstrated **downstream** gaps behind this
boundary. Earlier public snapshots described `priv_webapi.o` as the current Merlin-side
blocker; that is **superseded** — it was only reachable in earlier runs that had crossed the
`invalid_*` boundary using diagnostic objects, which are excluded from the clean port.

## Generation, not omission

An audit of published GPL 388.34458 versus the shipping 388_25206 firmware found the
difference between them is **narrow and localized**, not systemic. Across roughly twenty
shared libraries present in both, exported-ABI deltas are single-digit symbol counts, and
several are ABI-identical. Three areas account for essentially all of the divergence:

| area | published 388.34458 | shipping 388_25206 |
|---|---|---|
| `shared` provider surface | older surface | 44 exports our build does not have |
| `libwebapi` | component not present in the package | ships and is actively used |
| `rc` / S46 | `s46map_rptd` generation | `s46comm` generation |

Notably, `libnvram` itself is **ABI-identical** between the two — the current blocker is about
which component *provides* those two symbols, not about `nvram` differing.

Pinned Merlin generally tracks the **shipping** 388_25206 generation rather than the published
388.34458 one.

> **GPL 388.34458 is not described here as incomplete.** It is internally coherent and
> standalone-buildable for its own generation. It simply is not the same generation as the
> currently shipping firmware. Nothing in this repository asserts that ASUS withheld anything.

## The external dependency

The key remaining input is a source/GPL package matching RT-AXE7800 firmware
`3.0.0.4.388_25206`, or the current `388_25xxx` generation.

**No matching public package has been located.** ASUS's published RT-AXE7800 GPL package is
388.34458; searches of the support pages and the CDN naming convention did not locate a
package for the `388_25xxx` line. This is reported as *not located* — it is **not** a claim
that such a package does or does not exist.

A request for the complete matching source package has been submitted through ASUS's normal
open-source channel. Correspondence itself is not published here.

## If a package arrives

[`repro/intake`](repro/intake/ACCEPTANCE-MATRIX.md) contains the read-only plan for evaluating
one objectively:

- [`ACCEPTANCE-MATRIX.md`](repro/intake/ACCEPTANCE-MATRIX.md) — per-gap PASS / FAIL /
  INCONCLUSIVE criteria. File absence alone is never FAIL.
- [`PACKAGE-PROVENANCE-CHECKLIST.md`](repro/intake/PACKAGE-PROVENANCE-CHECKLIST.md) —
  identity and provenance fields. Filenames and version numbers are treated as unreliable:
  388.34458 carries a *higher* build number than 388_25206 while being older and a different
  generation.
- [`GENERATION-DELTA-AUDIT.md`](repro/intake/GENERATION-DELTA-AUDIT.md) — the measured
  three-way comparison.
- [`CROSS-PRODUCT-DEPENDENCY-MAP.md`](repro/intake/CROSS-PRODUCT-DEPENDENCY-MAP.md) — which
  dependencies a matching package would *not* fix, because Merlin inherited them from other
  ASUS product lines.
- [`PRE-ASUS-CLOSURE.md`](repro/intake/PRE-ASUS-CLOSURE.md) — final classifications.
- [`tools/inspect-gpl-generation-gaps.sh`](tools/inspect-gpl-generation-gaps.sh) — read-only
  generation-gap inspector. Complements
  [`tools/verify-asus-gpl-drop.sh`](tools/verify-asus-gpl-drop.sh), which covers package
  identity. Neither writes to, extracts into, or modifies a supplied package.

## Merlin-side adaptations (independent of ASUS)

Two dependencies that pinned Merlin inherited from *other* ASUS product lines were resolved
with model-correct source guards — **not** stubs:

| symbol | inherited from | resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `get_fh_if_prefix_by_unit` | RT-BE86U lineage | guarded on `RTCONFIG_MULTILAN_CFG`, which this model does not set |
| `hnd_boardid_cmp` | RT-BE96U lineage | its branch scoped to the model it is written for; the branch was link-live but runtime-dead here |

Both patches are published in
[`repro/clean-replay-v11/patches`](repro/clean-replay-v11/patches). No currently demonstrated
blocker is of a kind that a matching ASUS package could not address.

## Why the freeze

Every remaining unknown — whether a matching package supplies the two `invalid_*` symbols,
ships `libwebapi`, or is the `s46comm` generation — is decidable only by examining such a
package. The intake tooling to decide it already exists. Continuing to build or adapt would
mean guessing at private validation semantics, which this project does not do.

## Scope and conduct

- Stock firmware is used **only** as a read-only ABI/runtime oracle, by observation of
  exported and imported symbol names. No proprietary implementation is reverse engineered,
  reconstructed, or republished.
- Embedded credential and API-key symbols are recorded by existence and size only. Their
  values are never read or published.
- No donor binaries from other models are used as build inputs. Other models' objects appear
  only as read-only symbol oracles in analysis.
- No feature is disabled merely to make a build progress.
